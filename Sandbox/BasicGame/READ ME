//READ ME
For the project to run successfully the user will have to install a Java SDK (we use Java 17 SDK) which can be found
at the following link: https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.6_windows-x64_bin.exe

Occasionally, when the game needs to run on a new dev environment, the project will throw an error that the program
failed to run due the filenames. To solve this please edit the image variables at the start of the BasicGame class
and possibly the image file names inside each of the other classes.

Since we collaborated on GitHub, we have made the project visible to the public. If you wish to see the group commits
please follow the link: https://github.com/541270/Deep_Space_PIG/settings

Thank you and we hope you enjoy the game.
